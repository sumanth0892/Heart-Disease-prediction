# Heart-Disease-prediction
Predict heart disease through two ways - Categorical prediction and Binary prediction. 
This project aims to build classifiers (using deep learning) to predict heart disease in two ways:
Categorical Classification - The target variable can take on more than two values, such as the intensity of heart attack etc.
Binary classification - The target variable can take on just two values, such as heart diesase/no heart disease.
